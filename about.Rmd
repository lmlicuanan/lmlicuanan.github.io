### Bio

Hi, I'm Lino Licuanan. I am a product manager with 3 years of experience in the Philippine fintech space orchestrating product strategy from concept to execution.

Particularly interested in products where data plays a central role in delivering superior CX, returns, and social benefit. Happy to consult with organizations on how to go about driving that.

Proficient in R & SQL for practical data science & analytics. Graduating MSc Industrial Engineering student @ UP Diliman by end of 2022. In my free time I boulder, go night running, and listen to podcasts.
