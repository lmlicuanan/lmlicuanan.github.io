### Bio

Hi, I'm Lino Licuanan. I'm a product manager with 3 years of experience in the fintech space (<a href=https://www.paymaya.com>PayMaya</a>, <a href=https://www.firstcircle.ph>First Circle</a>). Proficient in R & SQL for practical data science & analytics. Graduating MSc Industrial Engineering student @ UP Diliman by end of 2022.

Particularly interested in products where data plays a central role in delivering superior CX, returns, and social benefit. Happy to consult with organizations on how to go about driving that.

In my free time I boulder, go night running, and listen to podcasts.
